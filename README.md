The Real-Time Tilt Monitoring and Correction System is an innovative safety solution designed to prevent accidents caused by uneven load distribution in heavy vehicles like lorries. By integrating the MPU-3050 tilt sensor with an Arduino microcontroller, the system continuously monitors vehicle tilt in real-time.

When unsafe deviations occur due to improper load arrangements or road conditions, the system immediately alerts drivers via a buzzer-based feedback mechanism. This enables proactive corrections before instability or accidents happen.

By combining IoT technology, automated tilt detection, and real-time monitoring, the project enhances road safety, reduces cargo damage, and ensures compliance with transportation safety standards. It represents a practical step toward smarter and safer logistics.
